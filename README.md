# [Galactic Market Foundation Tweak](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1868834704)
This mod updates the galactic market event chain, assigning empires with a higher trade_income a higher chance to host the galactic market station.

It is compatible with anything and everything, and can be activated and removed during a game (though it will only take effect the next time the host for the galactic market station is chosen).
